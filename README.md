# Google-Keep-Desktop-App

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Google Keep desktop application in action.**

This is an Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron JS documentation.

A breif description of files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `store.js` - Maintains the app window size while closing and launching.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start).
